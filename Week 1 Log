This week's TryHackMe room gave us a welcome to the site, as well as a brief introduction to offensive and defensive cyber security. For defensive security it showed us
an short description on what a security analyst is and what they do, and for offensive security it showed a penetration tester. 
Security analysts generally speaking "monitor various systems in the organisation and detect whether any of these systems are being attacked."
Penetration testers are "legally employed by an organization to find vulnerabilities in their products."
